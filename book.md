# Book

We are working on a jupyter book based on the lectures for this course. This will be an interactive jupyter book with text, diagrams and snippets of code in the middle, so it's easy for you to play around and understand the concepts.

Here's the [link to the book](https://gtbook.github.io/robotics/intro.html)!
